# The FLAC Specification

This git repository was used in developing the FLAC specification document that is now published as [RFC 9639](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9639).
Currently, it only contains the example files used in the document. Additionally, GitHub has some wiki items linked to this repo, which could be regarded
part of the repository in some way, which are used in the published document. See https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/flac-specification/wiki
